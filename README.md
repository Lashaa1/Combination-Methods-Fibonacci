# Combination-Methods-Fibonacci
 Description: The project is a study of various methods for calculating Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming algorithms and sums of numbers using combinations of given numbers (1 and 2). The project implements recursive algorithms that find all possible combinations that make up a given number of Fibonacci numbers. The project demonstrates the use of search algorithms and a combinational approach.
 Task: find the number of ways in which the number \ (n \) can be represented as a sum of combinations of ones and twos (for example, the number 4 has 5 combinations, the number 5 has 8 combinations, and so on 5,8,13 we get Fibonacci numbers and visualize everything clearly possible combinations)
